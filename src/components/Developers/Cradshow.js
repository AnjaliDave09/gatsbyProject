        <p>It was October 2020, when I came across Pesto Remote Program at Pesto Tech. Fortunately, I got selected and completed the program, under the mentorship of Arfat Salman and Ayush Jaiswal. This has been an incredible learning journey so far. Over the program, I've learned many things that have made me a better developer. I can see the difference in how I work, approach problems, and create solutions in a way that wasn't there before. I am very thankful to Arfat, Satyam, Vivek, and entire Pesto Tech team for all their support during the program. Looking forward to contributing to this great community Pesto Tech has built.</p>

      <p>A few months ago, I came across the Pesto Remote program at Pesto Tech. I immediately applied and luckily got selected as well. This has been an incredible journey so far. Over the last four months, I've learned many things that have made me a better developer. I can see the difference in how I work, approach problems, and create solutions in a way that wasn't there before. I am very thankful to Arfat, Nidhin, Vivek, Ayush and the entire Pesto tech team for all their guidance and support during the program. I look forward to contributing to this beautiful community built by Pesto Tech</p>
